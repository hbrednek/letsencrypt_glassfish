# letsencrypt_glassfish
A script to simplify the installation and maintenance of Letsencrypt certificates in glassfish or payara web servers.

This script is intended to simplify the installation of a Let's Encrypt certificate in a glassfish/payara server and provide an automated way of renewing that certificate when it is about to expire.

There exists a significant amount of documentation on the web which addresses this problem but I have found much of it to be ambiguous and incomplete.  This is an attempt to remove that ambiguity and incompleteness by giving a real world working example which can be modified to suit a particular situation.
